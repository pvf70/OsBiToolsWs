# OsBiToolsWs
OsBiTools is Open Source project for data visualization on the Web

Here is the short description of the project (full description can be found here - http://www.osbitools.com/project-idea).

If you have some data in offline storage (SQL Database, CSV files, Excel etc) and you need somehow visualize such data on the web (chart, tables, diagrams etc) 
than you definitely need to look & try this project because this is what (and why) it was build for.

Term BI (Business Intelligence) might be a bit confusing here however this project can be used as simple BI (why not) as well it can be used for real-tmie data visualization, 
GEO data visualization (in roadmap), for scientific purposes and so on.

OsBiTools consists of 2 layers

Web Services â€“ convert any data using predefined dataset maps into JSON
Front End Tools - set of GUI utilities that:
        a) helps with data set mapping for "Web Service" layer  - "Map Editor"
        b) helps converting JSON from "Web Service" layer into something visual (chart, diagrams, gauges etc.) - "Page Designer"

This is in brief what overall OSBiTools does. This project covers "Web Services" layer.
